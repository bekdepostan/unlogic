    <article>
        <p>Some time ago I wrote a post about <a class="reference external" href="http://unlogic.co.uk/2012/06/06/strong-passwords/">strong passwords</a>.
That was three years ago and I figured I might as well revist what I wrote back then.</p>
<p>Since then technology has moved on a lot, and the number of password breaches has increased,
aswell as the number of reports mocking our poorly chosen passwords.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, I am still using 15-18 random character passwords. I'm no longer
lowercase only, but a mixture of upper, lower, digit, and punctuation. The length depends
on how long I am allowed to make my passwords. Believe it or not, some sites limit you to
a maximum length of 12, possibly less on some sites. Silly huh? Not only that, but still they
tell me my 18 character password without punctuation or digits is less secure than a
4 character mixed character password. Hmph.</p>
<p>But what is cropping up more and more, and what I wanted to write about, is the password
rules on signup pages. For example &quot;Your password must be at least 8
characters long, contain one upper case letter, and a number.&quot; Sometimes a <em>special
character</em> is thrown into the mix too. The issue here is, that although your final
password is more secure (in theory), the search space for a valid password is reduced.
With some attackers being able to generate 1 trillion guesses per second, keeping the
size of the search space large will help.</p>
<p>By how much difference does it make? Well that's what I want to figure out.</p>
<p>So using the commonly used english alphabet with digits and
special characters we have the following available</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Name | Content | Character Count
-----|---------|-----------------
lower | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz | 26
upper | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ | 26
digits | 0123456789 | 10
special | !&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?&#64;[\]^_{\|}~` | 32
</pre>
<p>Let's assume that I have a list of password hashes from somewhere. I know
that the password is exactly 6 characters long (which I think is
a reasonably common password length these days), and I also know what rules
govern the choice of password when it is created. We'll look at these rules in
turn and see how much difference they make. I fix the password length so I don't
introduce too many variables.</p>
<p>I'll be basing the calculations of a few assumptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hashes are SHA256</li>
<li>We have a <em>reasonable</em> PC available (1x NVidia gtx580), managing 355 Mh/s (355,000,000 hashes/s) (<a class="reference external" href="https://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/#performance)">ref</a></li>
<li>These are pure bruteforce attacks. No wordlists, permutation or combination attacks</li>
<li>Timings for each attack assume <em>worst case</em>. i.e. we have to run through all guesses.
Usually an attack stops when a valid match is found, shortening the attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's analyse how different password creation rules affect the duration of the attack.</p>
<p>For reference, these are the number of possible combinations for each set of
characters</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Possible characters | Character count | Number of combinations
--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------
lower only | 26 | 308,915,776
upper and lower | 52 | 19,770,609,664
upper, lower, digits | 62 | 56,800,235,584
upper, lower, digits, special | 94 | 689,869,781,056
</pre>
<div class="section" id="no-rules">
<h2>No rules ##</h2>
<p>Using any combination of characters the number of possible passwords is <em>689,869,781,056</em>.
It would take <em>1943.29 seconds</em> (689,869,781,056 / 355,000,000) to crack this password.
That's just over half an hour.</p>
<p><em>Attack time</em> : 1943.29seconds</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="at-least-one-upper-case">
<h2>At least one upper case ##</h2>
<p>If we are forced to chose at least one upper case character, we are also saying that
there are no passwords now with just lowercase characters. The number of possible
combinations is now <em>689,869,781,056 - 308,915,776 = 689,560,865,280</em>, or <em>99%</em> of
he original search space. This is a small impact of only 1 second.</p>
<p><em>Attack time</em> : 1942.42seconds</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="at-least-one-upper-case-and-one-digit">
<h2>At least one upper case and one digit ##</h2>
<p>Now we know that there are no passwords with just lowercase, or with lower and uppercase only.
Therefore we can also remove these from the list of possibilities. Our new number is now
<em>689,869,781,056 - 308,915,776 - 19,770,609,664 = 669,790,255,616</em> or <em>97%</em> of our search space.
Now we're starting to see savings of up around 100seconds. In the grand scheme of things,
still not much</p>
<p><em>Attack time</em> : 1886.73seconds</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="must-contain-all-of-the-above">
<h2>Must contain all of the above ##</h2>
<p>Upper, lower, digits, and special all need to be present. Therefore we can remove all the
other possiblities for a grand total of:
<em>689,869,781,056 - 308,915,776 - 19,770,609,664 - 56,800,235,584 = 612,990,020,032</em> or
<em>88%</em> of the original. Now we've saved another 100 seconds.</p>
<p><em>Attack time</em> : 1726.73seconds</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion ##</h2>
<p>Although contrived, this scenario should indicate that <em>forcing</em> people to do
things in the interest of security can help attackers too. If we are allowed
to use any character out of the full set, an attack would have taken 4 minutes more than
if we are forced to create a <em>secure</em> password that <em>must</em> use certain characters.
The difference isn't much if you look above, but bear in mind that the longest attack
is <em>1.12</em> times longer. If we extrapolate this to a 8 character password,
it's a difference of almost 2 years (51.18 vs 49.7).</p>
<p>Needless to say, knowing the minimum length reduces the search space once again,
because now I won't even bother with anything below 8 characters. That's a fairly big
chunk of possibilities.</p>
<p>The times can be further optimised by employing wordlists, known substitutions and other
rules. The more you know about the nature of the password, the less time it takes
to crack it. Yes, applying rules and substitutions to wordlists takes time, but it's
insignificant to the amount of time they can shave off of a brute force attack. And
the more an attacker knows about the nature and composition of your password, the
better they can tailor their wordlists.</p>
<p>Even <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/snowden-sexy-margaret-thatcher-password-isnt-so-sexy/">Edward Snowden's advice isn't bulletrpoof</a></p>
<p>The key really is not to force people to have a specific password combination, but
to encourage good password creation. Long, random, and unpredictable, passwords
from a large vat of possibilities.</p>
<p>Don't tell attackers what the password isn't. Let them guess.</p>

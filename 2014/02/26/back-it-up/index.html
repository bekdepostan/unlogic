		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>For years I've been paying for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> in order to ensure
my photos, music, and other import data doesn't get lost in a hard drive crash, theft or fire.
I don't think I really need to go over all the reason why you should backup your data, do I?
But you should at least have a local backup, and ideally an offsite one too.</p>
<p>So why did I stop paying for Backblaze? No real reason. It came up to the renewal date
and I thought &quot;I wonder if I can do this a little cheaper perhaps?&quot;. After all, I'm not
a stranger to technology.</p>
<p>For Christmas I was lovingly gifted a 2TB
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280">WD Mybook Live drive</a>
and thought this is what I will use for backups (amongst other things). To give you
an overview of what I need to backup:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Around 40GB of photos</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't take a lot of photos, after all, I'm no professional, but those that I do
take are dear to me. So they need to be backed up</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">MP3s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I actually have those on Google Play, so they are already kinda backed up.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A few MB of documents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The usual stuff like invoices, receipts, correspondence, etc</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A few GB of code</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's what I do. So there's quite a bit of it, and not all of it is on Github.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all spread across an old iMac I rarely use and a MacBook Pro which is my
daily use machine. I also want to have a local backup and an offsite backup.</p>
<p>So first off I had to pick some software that will at least copy the relevant files
to the WD and create snapshots as a bonus. Because I'm an old command line lover, I
first opted for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/">rdiff-backup</a> which, after some
set up and testing, worked really well. I'd run the backup whenever I changed some
important files, or at least once a week. Then, on Sunday I would rsync the backup onto
a memory stick which I always have with me.</p>
<p>This was fine until my connection dropped in the middle of
a backup operation. What happens then is that the target dir is corrupt and rdiff-backup
tries to roll back the recent backup. Which is fine in most cases, but in my case something
got stuck and it never completed the roll back.
I blew the directory away and started again, during which I looked at some alternatives (free),
seeing as I now had some time to kill.</p>
<p>First I thought &quot;I can give this Time Machine thing a try. After all, it's free and
it's built right into the OS (sorta)&quot;. For some reason though it wouldn't let me select a mount
as a backup target. Probably because they don't want you backing your local disks to
your local disks?</p>
<p>So that was out of the question. Then I thought I would checkout <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crashplan.com">Crashplan</a>
as they were always coming up as an alternative to Backblaze and is also cross platform.
I checked out their free service which allows you to backup to a remote host, and
conveniently it also supports backing up to local folders.</p>
<p>So I downloaded it, did a basic setup and fired it off, along with an up-to-date
rdiff-backup. Both take a little bit of time as it's the first backup, but that doesn't
bother me much, the incrementals will be quicker. What I wanted to know was how big the
backup will be.</p>
<p>Surprisingly Crashplan's initial backup is over 1GB less than the rdiff-backup. I imagine
that it will get bigger, as I have it set to keep a longer history, but still, that's
quite a saving. It also runs in the background, so no manual intervention needed.
It'll just tick along and backup behind the scenes just like Backblaze did.</p>
<p>As for my offsite, I'll still use my USB stick with rdiff-backup mostly because
I need to copy the data onto a remote machine with rsync. Crashplan creates a single file for the backup
which will be a pain to copy each time. Using rsync to copy off an rdiff backup is
much quicker after the initial.</p>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So basically I am now running Crashplan locally having left Backblaze. I will say
that I would have stayed with Backblaze if I wasn't prone to tinkering and I
wasn't averse shelling out a bit extra for a family plan. As it is, I can now
backup all the machines in the house for the price of nothing
(plus hardware accessories ;))</p>
<p>I've only been running it for a day so far, so time will tell if it's as good
Backblaze, but so far this is the backup solution I am going with. I'll update
this post with any discoveries if they are minor, or write new posts if they
require a bit more space.</p>

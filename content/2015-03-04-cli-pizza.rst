Recently someone was talking about ordering Pizza from within
`Houdini <http://sidefx.com>`_. I figured that it must be possible somehow.
I looked for an API and only found a US based, possibly out of date,
`API for Dominos <https://www.npmjs.com/package/dominos>`_ written in node.js.
However I needed one that worked with the UK version of the Dominos site.
So I began working on deconstructing the URLs that the Dominos site uses to get
menus, place orders and such, and started building a Python API around that.

So far I've got a few features working and am happy with the progress. Here's
a little video of how it works at this stage:

.. raw:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/17295.js" id="asciicast-17295" async></script>

Quite a bit to do still, but happy with the progress. I'm planning to write up how
I figured out all the API calls in order to interact with their backend, so stay
tuned for that. Follow on `Twitter <https://www.titter.com/binaryheadache>`_ or
subscribe to the `RSS <http://unlogic.co.uk/feed.xml>`_. The code will go up
on Github once it's more feature complete.

UPDATE: `it's on github <https://github.com/Svenito/dominos>`_

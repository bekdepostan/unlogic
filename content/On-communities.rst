:title: On communities


A long time ago, in a life that is part of scriptures, I used to skate[board].
I was never particularily good at it to be fair, but I enjoyed it a lot. I had
a few tricks I could do, and I could fling myself around a skatepark, but nothing
noteworthy. One of the best things about it was the community. That group of
skater buddies you hung out with, the ones you'd head to your local skate spots with
or perhaps a longer trip to a skate park. You had fun while you all repeatedly tried 
tricks you couldn't yet do, or perhaps just cruised around, enjoying yourself.

Not only that, but you also encouraged eachother to try new things, to keep
practicing, gave eachother advice on what might help you land that trick. It 
really helped when someone would tell you that your feet are in the wrong
position, or perhaps try moving your foot to a different position. Or simply
would just say "you almost had it there, keep going". Even those skaters that could
throw tricks out like it was nothing would offer some advice and help out. 
Maybe I was just lucky to find the people I did, but in the majority it was a
very good set of people. Some you knew by name, others you would just regularily 
see at the local skate spot, but you all had something in common, and that
brought you together.
Yes there were people who weren't quite so supportive, but they also didn't 
have a lot friends either :)

We knew that not everyone is born able to stand on a board, and we can't all pop and ollie
from day one. It's about perseverance, practice, overcoming repeated failure, and
having fun while doing it. You won't land a kickflip on your first try. Probably
not even on your tenth. You just go to keep trying and failing until one day you stop
failing, then you keep on practicing until that kickflip seems natural and you're
able to do it reliably.  
This might mean just rolling backwards and forwards in a car park for an hour, but
when you land it... it feels great.

So now that I've set the scene, let me just say: 

**I wish more tech communities were like this.**

So many times I've seen people on forums and other communities make fun of people
who are trying to learn how to do something that they've never tried before. Even if
they are trying to do something advanced without having learned the basics first,
that's no reason to make fun of them or be rude. Tell them what they should do first.
They've done something that you think is stupid? Instead of just laughing at them, why
not tell them how to do it right? Just like none of us could skateboard from day one, none
of us were born programmers. We all had to start somewhere. We made stupid mistakes
because we didn't know better. But we made the mistake and learned from it.

You lean forward when you drop-in on a halfpipe, you faceplant. Next time you know to
lean back. But it's ok, we all did it at some point and we'll tell you what you did
wrong and offer some advice.

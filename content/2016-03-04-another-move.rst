I can't keep still it seems. After Octopress, Jekyll, and Hugo, this site is now generated by `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_.
A few years ago I tried Pelican and wasn't taken by it, which is why I chose Octopress. This got a little too complicated, and 
I got very lost when I had to troubleshoot anything. I opted for a simpler version of it, and thus chose Jekyll.

I liked Jekyll. It was straight forward, easy to use, and did pretty much everything I wanted. Then Hugo came along
and I thought I'd give that a try. It is incredibly fast at generating the static site, I have to admit. It's got a lot of features and seems very
solid. Its biggest plus is that it a single binary. But I fell out of love with it. Trying out different themes was a pain. Each theme put common
attributes like social links, author name etc, under different group or different names. So when you wanted to swap themes, you often had
to edit the config file a lot.

Then I revisited Pelican and got to know it, and I liked it. Sure, it's not as fast as Hugo, taking around 6-7 seconds to generate this site, but
I have managed to get the site working how I want, very easily. It was still a lot of work, converting all the markdown to rst (didn't have to,
but I chose to do so), but after a few scripts and manual tweaks, I have something that I am happy with.

So hopefully more posts to come then....

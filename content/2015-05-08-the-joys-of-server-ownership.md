This post serves mostly as a "note to self".

I just ordered myself a super cheap VPS from [Ramnode](http://ramnode.com) as I have
a little project I would like to setup and see if I can make it work.

But first I had to setup the server (Debian 7.0) and it's been a while since I've done that, so
some reading was in order to remind myself of all the joys. Thus I decided to note this
down for myself and anyone else who's interested. So it's not an in depth explanation
by any means.

## Securing ##

I'm not looking for bullet proof as this won't be a production server and won't
hold any sensitive info, but I'd like to know that it's at least somewhat locked
down.

So first off install [Fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). This
will lock out users who fail to authenticate too often. Ramnode actually have a
[good video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmVoqFv_lGU). As we'll
only allow key based authentication it's a bit redundant, but if you want to
go that way, there's the info.

Then turn off password authentication for SSH as I'll be using only keys to 
authenticate. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_conf` and change the following lines to read:

{% highlight console %}
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure you have uploaded your [public key](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys) to
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and set the permissions on `.ssh` and `authorized_keys` on the
server to `700` and `600` respectively.

I also changed the default SSH port to something else, as that already keeps the number of automated 
bruteforcers down. Do this by changing the following line in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

{% highlight console %}
Port 22
{% endhighlight %}

Set it to anything that doesn't clash with other services. i.e. not 25 or 80 for example.

Once configured `sudo service sshd reload` to pick up the changes.

So next up `iptables`. I followed [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-using-ip-tables-on-ubuntu-12-04)
which gives you a good start. Be sure to run `sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT` first.
Otherwise you'll end up blocking your current connection and... yeah, ok, I made that mistake.

Then allow what you need and default to dropping the rest. It's all in the URL above, but to re-iterate:

{% highlight console %}
# Accept connections on port 22
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --destination-port 22 -j ACCEPT

# Deny all other input
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -syn -j DROP
{% endhighlight %}

You will need to run the first line for each port that needs to be able to accept
incoming connections. 

I additionally set up [knockd](http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock) just to play around with it.

To do this edit `/etc/knockd.conf` and set the port sequences. It should have a default
set for enabling and disabling the ssh port. Edit this to reflect any port changes. If you want to run miltiple commands
for a knock, simply concatenate the command with `&&`. You can even make one command open
a port for a given time. As we have our *keep established connections" rule in `iptables` we 
can do

{% highlight console %}
[opencloseSSH]
        sequence      = 2222:udp,3333:tcp,4444:udp
        seq_timeout   = 15
        tcpflags      = syn,ack
        start_command = /usr/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --syn --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        cmd_timeout   = 10
        stop_command  = /usr/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --syn --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
{% endhighlight %}

Lifted from the docs. This will allow and block only the IP from where the knock originated.

That's all for now. Postfix next time....

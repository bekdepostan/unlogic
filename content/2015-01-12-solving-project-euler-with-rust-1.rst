It's time to poke at `Rust <http://www.rust-lang.org/>`_ a little bit. And what
better way to get acquainted with a new language than to solve
some problems with it? And seeing as there's not always a suitably
simple problem handy, I've picked some problems from `Project Euler <https://projecteuler.net>`_
to tackle. I am using Rust 1.0.0Alpha in this post.

The first problem is:

    Multiples of 3 and 5
    Problem 1
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
    we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
    
Ok, so sounds fairly ok and I'm going to add another requirement: To prompt the 
user for the max number (in this case the 1000). Just a little extra exercise. I've
read the `Rust By Example <http://rustbyexample.com/>`_ pages and the new and official
`Rust book <http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-alpha/book>`_ and let's see how we get on.

First let's define some structure:

.. code-block:: rust

	
	fn solve(max_num: i32) -> i32 {
	    let result = max_num;
	    result
	}
	
	fn main() {
	    println!("Total sum: {}", solve(10));
	}

:code:`cargo run` simply prints out :code:`Total sum: 10`. That's what we expect. I use :code:`let result = 10;`
because I will be putting the result into a variable. The :code:`result` with the semicolon
omitted is our return value. So far, so good.

Let's try to sum up the relevant numbers with a hard coded max value of 10.

.. code-block:: rust

	
	fn solve(max_num: i32) -> i32 {
	    let numbers = range(1, max_num).filter(|i| *i % 3 == 0 || *i % 5 == 0);
	    numbers.fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x)
	}
	
	fn main() {
	    println!("Total sum: {}", solve(10));
	}

Looks fun, right? So what's going on? First we generate a range iterator of numbers
divisible by 3 and 5. Pay attention to the :code:`*i` which we need to use because the
filter value :code:`i` is of type :code:`&i32` and without it Rust handily tells you the same:

    error: binary operation :code:`%` cannot be applied to type :code:`&i32`

Next we use `fold` to sum all the entries. The `docs <http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-alpha/core/iter/trait.IteratorExt.html#method.fold>`_ 
explain fold like this:

    Performs a fold operation over the entire iterator, returning the eventual
    state at the end of the iteration.

In this case we can liken it to Python's :code:`map` function if you like, but a little different.
The first argument is the initial value that gets assigned to :code:`acc`. Then the result of :code:`acc + x`
gets assigned to :code:`acc` to each entry :code:`x`. Ultimately it's a :code:`sum` in Python world.

Functionally we're done. The problem is solved as far as the initial requirement are concerned.
But I want to add some user input, so let's go over that part next.

.. code-block:: rust

	
	fn solve(max_num: i32) -> i32 {
	    let numbers = range(1, max_num).filter(|i| *i % 3 == 0 || *i % 5 == 0);
	    numbers.fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x)
	}
	
	fn main() {
	    print!("Enter the max number: ");
	    let input = std::io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect("Failed to read line");
	    let input_num: Option<i32> = input.trim().parse();
	    
	    println!("Total sum: {}", solve(input_num));
	}

We read the user input and make sure it was read ok (this is explained in detail in the book)
then we convert the input to :code:`i32`. The :code:`trim` is required to remove the newline char
at the nd of the input and the :code:`parse` does the conversion.

But if we try to run this we get the following error:

    error: mismatched types: expected :code:`i32`, found :code:`core::option::Option<i32>` 
    (expected i32, found enum core::option::Option)

Right, because it's still an :code:`Option<i32>` type. Helpfully the book explains that we need to 
unwrap the :code:`Option`, and the best way to do this is with :code:`match`:

.. code-block:: rust

	
	fn solve(max_num: i32) -> i32 {
	    let numbers = range(1, max_num).filter(|i| *i % 3 == 0 || *i % 5 == 0);
	    numbers.fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x)
	}
	
	fn main() {
	    print!("Enter the max number: ");
	    let input = std::io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect("Failed to read line");
	    let input_num: Option<i32> = input.trim().parse();
	    
	    let num = match input_num {
	        Some(num) => num,
	        None      => {
	            println!("Please input a number!");
	            return;
	        }
	    };
	
	    println!("Total sum: {}", solve(num));
	}

Let's run this and see what happens:

.. code-block:: console

	ninja:euler_1 unlogic$ cargo run

Some warnings about unstable calls, but it's an Alpha release, so what else can we expect? But the end
result is there.

Well that was a nice little trip into Rust land, wasn't it?

UPDATE: I posted this on `reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2s9lam/just_started_playing_with_rust_heres_a_write_up/>`_ 
and having taken some suggestions on board, I have made some small changes:

.. code-block:: rust

	use std::iter::AdditiveIterator;
	
	fn solve(max_num: i32) -> i32 {
	    let mut numbers = (1..max_num).filter(|i| *i % 3 == 0 || *i % 5 == 0);
	    numbers.sum()
	}
	
	fn main() {
	    print!("Enter the max number: ");
	    let input = std::io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect("Failed to read line");
	    let input_num: Option<i32> = input.trim().parse();
	            
	    let num = match input_num {
	        Some(num) => num,
	        None      => {
	            println!("Please input a number!");
	            return;
	        }
	    };
	
	    println!("Total sum: {}", solve(num));
	}

Also made the code (and all future solutions) available on `Github <https://github.com/Svenito/euler_rust>`_

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>These days, when you sit at your box, tapping out your code be it in whatever
language you use these days, you usually have one or more tabs open, ready to
help you with any programming issues: DuckDuckGo, Google, Stack Overflow, Reddit,
or whatever your go to site for answers is.</p>
<p>This is all well and good, and it allows you to solve a problem quickly, usually
in a way that someone else has already proven works. It absolves from having to not
only design and implement your solution, but also from worrying about whether you
did it right. After all, if someone from Stack Overflow with masses of reputation
did it that way, it can't be wrong, can it? Besides, you saved yourself a lot of
time which allows you to move on and get to finishing the rest of the project, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe, maybe not. But that's not the point I want to make here. While the
<em>tried and tested</em> answers are often effective and suitable for your needs, they
don't provide you with something more valuable: exercise. I don't mean squats, or
a big cardio session, I mean mental exercise. It's easy to fall into this trap</p>
<blockquote>
I've got to parse this text file, capitalise every 10th word, and add a new line
if the line is over 120 characters long. I wonder what the best way to do that is...
I'll just check &lt;insert name of site here&gt; and see what others have done.</blockquote>
<p>That's great, no one is going to complain that you are being resourceful, and often
project time constraints don't let you spend too much time designing and testing out
various algorithms before you can confidently say: &quot;This is the right way to do it&quot;</p>
<p>But there are times when you have got that time. Be it a little personal project,
or perhaps your work project has a sane schedule, allowing you to poke around a little
more. For me it's little personal coding projects, things I do because I am curious
how I could implement it. Be that my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Svenito/Langton-Ant">Langton's Ant</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Svenito/Knight-s-Tour">Knight's tour</a>. Those are project I coded
offline.</p>
<p>And when I say offline, I mean I was on some form of public transport at the time,
commuting to work, without any internet what so ever. All I had where offline docs
for any APIs or other, and any other code I wrote in the past for reference. That's it.</p>
<p>At first it's hard. The temptation to look stuff up, thinking &quot;Someone must have
already done this...&quot; is huge. But you can't. You've unplugged. You have to do
this how <strong>you</strong> think is right. Even if you don't write any code for the entire
journey, you should be thinking about it, perhaps writing a snippet of code to test
out an idea. Once you've done this for a bit you will start to appreciate how
satisfying it is, writing your own code, without looking up what others have done.
To rely on your knowledge and thought processes to get the job done.</p>
<p>Not only does it feel good, but you start to retain more information about the API
or language you are using, simply because looking it up is not as easy as typing
some words into a browser. It's much quicker to just grab it from your head. Granted,
you can't retain <strong>all</strong> the information in your head, in those cases you might need
to get back online and look something up. But the amount of times you need to do that
will decrease.</p>
<p>So next time you feel like coding a little something, why not unplug from the internet
for an hour or so, and see how you get on. In this age of <em>always connected</em>, I can
only reccommend that any developer give this a try.</p>
